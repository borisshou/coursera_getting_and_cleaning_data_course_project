# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data 

## Description
This is the course project for the Coursera online course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata). Data is obtained from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), and the description of the data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The goal is to write a script, `run_analysis.R`, that reformats the data and extracts useful information out into a separate file, `summary.txt`. All the means and standard deviations of the original measurements are already in the data package and need to be extracted using the script. In addition, there are a total of 30 participants, each performing 6 activities in the experiment. The means of the means and standard deviations need to be taken with regard to each participant and each activity, and eventually placed in `summary.txt`. 

## Directions

1. Download and unzip the data.
2. Place `run_analysis.R` in the unzipped folder.
3. Run the script to obtain `summary.txt`.
